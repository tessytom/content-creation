        "[Neural Fitted Q Iteration](http://ml.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/former/_media/publications/rieecml05.pdf) was one of the first papers to demonstrate how to leverage recent advances in Deep Learning to approximate the Q-value by a neural network.$^1$\n",
        "In other words, the value $\\color{green}Q(\\color{red}{s}, \\color{blue}{a})$ are approximated by the output of a neural network $\\color{green}{Q_w}(\\color{red}{s}, \\color{blue}{a})$ for each possible action $\\color{blue}{a} \\in \\color{blue}{\\mathcal{A}}$.$^2$\n",
        "\n",
        "When introducing function approximations, and neural networks in particular, we need to have a loss to optimize. But looking back at the tabular setting above, you can see that we already have some notion of error: the **TD error**.\n",
        "\n",
        "By training our neural network to output values such that the *TD error is minimized*, we will also satisfy the Bellman Optimality Equation, which is a good sufficient condition to enforce, to obtain an optimal policy.\n",
        "Thanks to automatic differentiation, we can just write the TD error as a loss, e.g., with an $\\ell^2$ loss, but others would work too:\n",
        "\n",
        "\\begin{equation}\n",
        "L(\\color{green}w) = \\mathbb{E}\\left[ \\left( \\color{green}{r} + \\gamma \\max_\\color{blue}{a'} \\color{green}{Q_w}(\\color{red}{s'}, \\color{blue}{a'}) − \\color{green}{Q_w}(\\color{red}{s}, \\color{blue}{a})  \\right)^2\\right].\n",
        "\\end{equation}\n",
        "\n",
        "Then we can compute the gradient with respect to the parameters of the neural network and improve our Q-value approximation incrementally.\n",
        "\n",
        "NFQ builds on $\\color{green}Q$-learning, but if one were to update the Q-values online directly, the training can be unstable and very slow.\n",
        "Instead, NFQ uses a replay buffer, similar to what we see implemented above (Section 6.1), to update the Q-value in a batched setting.\n",
        "\n",
        "When it was introduced, it also was entirely off-policy using a uniformly random policy to collect data, which was prone to instability when applied to more complex environments (e.g. when the input are pixels or the tasks are longer and more complicated).\n",
        "But it is a good stepping stone to the more complex agents used today. Here, we will look at a slightly different and modernised implementation of NFQ.\n",
        "\n",
        "Below you will find an incomplete NFQ agent that takes in observations from a gridworld. Instead of receiving a tabular state, it receives an observation in the form of its (x,y) coordinates in the gridworld, and the (x,y) coordinates of the goal.\n",

        "<sub>$^2$ We could feed it $\\color{blue}{a}$ as well and ask $Q_w$ for a single scalar value, but given we have a fixed number of actions and we usually need to take an $argmax$ over them, it's easiest to just output them all in one pass.</sub>\n"
